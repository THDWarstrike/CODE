    <h3>
        "From the First Great Ninja War to the Last,
        Shinobi have WOUNDED AND COME TO HATE EACH OTHER
        for the benefit of their OWN Nation and Village.
        That HATRED led to A DESIRE FOR POWER,
        and that DESIRE FOR POWER CREATED SOMEONE LIKE ME.
        I too, was once FULL OF HATRED AND POWER!!!
        I WAS A JINCHUURIKI!!!
        I HATED THIS WORLD and ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT!!!
        I constantly thought of NOTHING BUT DESTROYING IT.
        I WAS NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT AKATSUKI IS NOW!!!
        However a certain Shinobi from Konoha STOPPED ME! (Uzumaki Naruto)
        HE SHED TEARS FOR ME!!!
        HIS ENEMY!!!
        EVEN THOUGH I HURT HIM...
        HE STILL HE CALLED ME HIS FRIEND!!!
        HE SAVED ME!!!
        MY ENEMY!!!
        MY FELLOW JINCHUURIKI!!!
        He suffered the SAME PAIN as me, and yet BORE NO ILL WILL!!!
        The moment WE UNDERSTAND each other's PAIN, our MALICE WILL DISAPPEAR!      
        THERE ARE NO ENEMIES HERE!
        We are ALL ONE and it is because we have ALL BEEN AFFECTED by Akatsuki!!!
        The Sand Village, Stone Village, Leaf Village, Mist Village, Cloud Village...
        THEY NO LONGER EXIST!!!        
        WE ARE NOW ONLY SHINOBI!!!
        IF YOU STILL CANNOT FORGIVE THE Sand Village THEN
        I WILL GIVE YOU MY HEAD ONCE THIS WAR IS OVER!
        OUR ENEMY IS NOW AFTER THE VERY FRIEND WHO SAVED ME!!!
        If they capture him then it will be THE END OF THE WORLD!!!
        I WANT TO PROTECT HIM!!!
        I WANT TO PROTECT THIS WORLD!!!
        HOWEVER, I AM TOO YOUNG and NAIVE TO DO SO...
        THAT IS WHY...
        I NEED ALL OF YOU TO GIVE ME YOUR STRENGTH!!!
        To protect our friends and this world, we will fight as one...
        Until our dying breaths..."
