You can use the hidden blade in combat as well which hasn't been seen since Orgins. You can build up your settlement ranging from a tattoo shop to the barracks. You can recruit and train for raids and missions.</p>

    <h1>The Future of the Franchise</h1>

    <p>Valhalla has had a lot of backlash cause of its long story. Me personally the longer the story the better the game. Well Ubisoft is set to make the next game in the franchise bigger and better. Me personally Ubisoft should make their next game where all of thier Assassin's all the way from Altaïr to Eivor get sent to the modern-day, what I mean by sent to modern-day is that the Aminus malfuncions and the Assassins memories take form in the modern day world. But for Ezio it will be from the game we last hear him from. You can decide which Assassin you play as but most importantly whatever character you chose should still have everything that you habe from the game that they are in if you have played that game.</p>

    <h1>Quotes from each assassin</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Altaïr-"Men must be free to do what they believe. It is not our right to punish one for thinking what they do, no matter how much we disagree."</li>
        
        <li>Ezio Auditore de Firenze-"We Work In The Dark To Serve The Light. We Are Assassins."</li>
        
        <li>Conner Kenway-"Sometimes standing against evil is more important than defeating it. The greatest heroes stand because it is right to do so, not because they believe they will walk away with their lives."</li>
        
        <li>Edward Kenway-"Men dream. But dreams hold no value here. What was first the bright light of hope has now turned into a long night of captivity. Lost in the dark, we surrender our minds and forget who we are. But some of us have woken up. They remind us that we all have a choice. To stand, not kneel. To oppose, not obey. To live, not just exist."</li>
        
        <li>Shay Cormac-"Life's hardest choices are the ones that force you to question your own moral code. My choices lead me here, standing against those I once called brothers. History may brand me traitor...rebel...or renegade. But in the end, it doesn't matter how history remembers me. What matters,is that I followed my own creed."</li>
        
        <li>Arno Dorian-"The Creed of the Assassin Brotherhood teaches us that nothing is forbidden to us. Once, I thought that we were free to do as we would.To pursue our ideals, no matter the cost. I understand now.Not a grant of permission.The Creed is a warning. Ideals too easily give way to dogma. Dogma becomes fanticism. No higher power sits in judgement of us. No supreme being watches to punish us for our sins. In the end, only we ourselves can guard against our obsession. Only We can decide whether the road we walk carries too high a toll."</li>

        <li>Evie Frye-"If none can match my skill, it is only because I've out-planned and out-smarted the rest."
        Jacob Frye-"Escape plan? When no one is left just walk out the front door."</li>

        <li>Bayek-"I am a medjay. Im a feather in the eagles wing. A living dagger. Plunged from the sky. Into the Heart of Chaos. Im truth,unknown. A scabbard unfilled. A son of the nile, and a defender of the people. You cannnot kill me for I walk among the dead. Come forth by day and I will guide you home."</li>

        <li>Alex/Kassandra-"Sometimes The Face We Show To The World Needs To Be One Of Strength, Despite The Chaos We Harbor Beneath."</li>

        <li>Eivor Varinsdottir-"If Your Hell Is Real, I'm Glad You'll Get To See It."</li>
    </ul>
