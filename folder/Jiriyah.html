        "In the Shinobi World, it's not how you live. It's how you die. A shinobi's life is not measured by how they live, but it's measured by what they've managed to acomplish before their death. And looking back, my life has really been full of nothing but failure, continually rejected by Tsunade, unable to stop my friend, and unable to protect either my student or my mentor. Compared to the great and celebrated deed of the Hokage, my actions are trifiling, insignficant things indeed. I wish  that I could have died like each of the Hokage, tale is only as good as its final turn of events. The polt twist. And mistakes are an important part of the plot to. I've lived my life, always beleiving that the lessons I learned are what homed me. I swore I accomplish a deed so great that it would obliterate all my failures. I die, a splended Shinobi at least that's how it was supposed to go. But this, my plot twist my tale ending like this. A great Lord elder prophesized that I would be the one to guide a revolution. A person who will make a great choice that will bring either peace or destruction to the world of the Shinobi. I thought I would defeat Pain, stop the Akatsuki and save the world from destruction. But in the end, I faild at that too. How pitiful, How sad, that this will be the ending twist to the tale of Jiraya the gallant, what a worthless story it turned out to be. Never going back on your word, no matter what and never giving up despite what the odds may tell you to do. Naruto, if that is truely your ninja way. Then as your teacher, I have no buisness at all mining. Because as everyone knows a student inherits his ninja way from his teacher right, Naruto? The Tale of Jiraya The Gallant. Well, now it will end a bit better, I hope. The final chapter. I'll call it frog the bottom of the well drifts off into the great ocean. Just barely glorious but glorious indeed. Now it is about time I put down my pen. Oh, that's right. What should I name the sequel? I wonder. Let's see. The Tale of Naruto Uzimaki. Yes, that has a nice ring to it."
