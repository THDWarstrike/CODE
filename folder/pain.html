        "You asked me why I'm doing all this 
        But even if I told you why I doubt very strongly that the knowledge would change anything at all. But let's say that I take the time to explain it to you. What do you think would happen then. My goal is to fulfill the dream even Jiraya sensei was unable to achieve.
        What I want is to create peace and bring about justice 
        Oh I see. That is noble of you 
        That would be justice. However 
        What about my family. My friends 
        My village. They suffer the same fate as this village at the hands of you Hidden Leaf ninja. How is it fair to let only you people preach about peace and justice. Once the land of fire and the Hidden Leaf had grown too big. To protect their national interests. They forced feudal clans to wage war against each other. And profited from it. Otherwise the people of the villages would have starved. As it happened. Our little nation and its villages became the battlefield where the great nations waged their war. 
        Each time they did. Our nation was ravaged and made to waste. After many such battles the great nation stabilized but our small nation suffered. And it barely recovered 
        You and I are both seeking the very same thing. We both want to achieve the peace that Jiraya sensei envisioned. You and I are the same. We are both motivated by our desire for peace and justice.
        A justice that I have delivered against the leaf village is no different from what you are trying to do to me. Everyone feels the same pain in losing something dear. You and I have both experienced that pain. You strive for your justice. 
        And I strive for mine. We're both just ordinary men who have been driven to seek vengeance in the name of justice. And if one comes to call vengeance Justice such justice will only breed further vengeance and trigger a vicious cycle of hatred.
        Right now we live in such a cycle. I know the past and can foretell our future. It is the same as our history. So we believe that human beings simply cannot understand each other and they never will. 
        The Shinobi World of ours is ruled by hatred 
        And hatred Alone.
        So Naruto. How would you confront this hatred in order to create peace 
        I want to know what your answer is"
